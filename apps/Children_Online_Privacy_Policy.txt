Overview
This Children’s Online Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to safeguarding children’s privacy and details our data handling practices. It complements our general Privacy Policy by focusing specifically on the protection of children under 13 in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and children under 16 in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Compliance with COPPA and GDPR
COPPA Compliance:
In accordance with the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we are committed to ensuring that no personal data is collected from children under the age of 13. This eliminates the need for parental consent for data collection, usage, or sharing practices.

GDPR Compliance:
Similarly, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we adhere to the regulations by not collecting any personal data from children under the age of 16 in applicable European Union member countries.

Verifiable Parental Consent
Given our policy of not collecting any personal data from children, obtaining verifiable parental consent is not required.

Teacher Consent in Place of a Parent
In alignment with COPPA guidelines, school administrators and teachers are permitted to act on behalf of parents in providing consent for school-based activities. However, since no personal data is collected from children, this consent process is not applicable.

Information We Collect from Children, How We Use It, and Parental Rights
Registration:
We do not require children to register or provide any personal information to access or use our applications. As a result, we do not collect, store, or share any personal data from children.

Automatic Information Collection and Persistent Identifiers:
Our services do not automatically collect information such as IP addresses, usage patterns, cookies, web beacons, or other unique identifiers from children.

Usage of Collected Information:
Since no data is collected, there is no usage or analysis of personal data related to children.

Sharing Information
We do not share any personal information with third parties under any circumstances.

Parental Rights
Since we do not collect any personal information from children, the parental rights regarding data review, consent revocation, data modification, and data deletion are inherently respected.
